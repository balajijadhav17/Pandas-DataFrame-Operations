### 1. DataFrame Basics
- Creating DataFrames from different sources (lists, dictionaries, NumPy arrays, CSV files, etc.).
- Understanding DataFrame properties like `shape`, `columns`, `index`, `dtypes`, etc.

### 2. DataFrame Operations
- Adding, modifying, and deleting columns.
- Dropping rows using primary keys or unique values.
- Filtering and slicing rows and columns using `loc` and `iloc`.

### 3. Handling Missing Data
- Detecting missing data with `isna()` and `notna()`.
- Filling missing data using `fillna()` with different strategies.
- Removing missing data using `dropna()`.

### 4. Working with Duplicates
- Identifying duplicate rows with `duplicated()`.
- Removing duplicate rows using `drop_duplicates()`.

### 5. Statistical and Descriptive Methods
- Aggregating data using methods like `mean()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, etc.
- Generating summary statistics with `describe()`.

### 6. Grouping and Aggregation
- Using `groupby()` for summarizing data.
- Aggregating multiple statistics using `agg()`.

### 7. Merging and Joining
- Merging two DataFrames with `merge()`.
- Joining DataFrames on indices with `join()`.

### 8. Exporting Data
- Saving DataFrames to CSV, Excel, and JSON formats.
